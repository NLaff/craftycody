So, this thing is for me. CodyBear. That’s me. I’ve been unrealistically angry a long time at really everything. You name it, I hate it. Why do I hate it? Probably for some reason that only makes sense to me. Sometimes my ranting about these things would make friends laugh. Sometimes. But I thought I could write all that shit down and make you laugh sometimes too.

I also like making things- all the things. Really into crochet right now. Come around sometimes to see what I’m making next. Maybe you can make it too. Maybe. Nah, just kidding, I believe in you.

Anyway, so I like making people laugh. I like the creative process of videos and writing. I also like making websites so all that stuff I just mentioned was a good excuse to make another site.

To sum up:

My name’s CodyBear and you better laugh.
