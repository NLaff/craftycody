The previous owners of our house took meticulous care of the lawn.

We did not.

After we closed, we immediately started renovating the interior and therefore stopped running the sprinklers since we weren't even living here yet. That obviously killed the yard and doubly so since we renovated during the summer.

However, we just learned that we have some of the most expensive water rates in the state of Texas, so we were pretty happy we stopped watering during that time. A couple of our neighbors have told us their first water bill was over $1000 because they didn't know. It was ridiculous.

But, because of all that, our front yard looked like hell. Just a bunch of brown, dead grass and two rather sad trees. One looks like it was hit by lightning at some point and the other is a sapling- so not really sad, just small.

We tried for a moment to bring the grass back and it worked well in the backyard, but the front yard would not get going no matter what we tried. Some patches returned, but it wasn't spreading as we had hoped. So, we decided to slowly start covering it up.

## Ideas

The first step was to draw out some ideas in my notebook. We mocked up several iterations, but there was honestly a lot of winging it as well.

## Dethatching

Dethatching is an important step when you have a ton of dead grass as we did. It was super, super thick and would have made anything on top of it lay crooked.

The process is simple but laborious. We took a [normal, metal rake](lowes.com/pd/CRAFTSMAN-58-in-L-Wood-Handle-Welded-steel-Garden-Rake/1000604757) and ripped up as much of the dead grass as we could throughout the yard. You're just looking to get it a little flatter and maybe expose dirt underneath.

There are also dethatching tools that can make this job easier. Our front yard isn't that large so we used the rake we already had.

## Landscape Fabric

Wherever you plan on putting rocks or beds, absolutely put down landscape fabric. You don't want to get stuck unsteadily walking over rocks while pulling out tiny weeds. We rolled it out over our entire yard. Be sure to get landscape pins to secure it into the ground. 

## Garden Beds

This is where a lot of the "winging it" took place.
