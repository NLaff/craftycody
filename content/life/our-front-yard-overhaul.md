+++
The previous owners of our house took meticulous care of the lawn.

We did not.

After we closed, we immediately started renovating the interior and therefore stopped running the sprinklers since we weren't even living here yet. That obviously killed the yard and doubly so since we renovated during the summer.

However, we just learned that we have some of the most expensive water rates in the state of Texas, so we were pretty happy we stopped watering during that time. A couple of our neighbors have told us their first water bill was over $1000 because they didn't know. It was ridiculous.

But, because of all that, our front yard looked like hell. Just a bunch of brown, dead grass and two rather sad trees. One looks like it was hit by lightning at some point and the other is a sapling- so not really sad, just small.

We tried for a moment to bring the grass back and it worked well in the backyard, but the front yard would not get going no matter what we tried. Some patches returned, but it wasn't spreading as we had hoped. This was a blessing really.

So, we decided to slowly start covering it up.
