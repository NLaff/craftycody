When we bought this house, the yard looked nice. I believe the previous owner really loved taking care of the lawn. However, there wasn't much in the way of gardens, plants, or ornamentation.

We started renovating immediately after purchasing and moved in once the reno was completed. Since we weren't in the house for a couple of months during the summer, the lawn suffered for it. We were left with a mostly dead yard in the front and back.

Slowly but surely we've been dethatching the thick, dead grass and creating flower beds. Well, cactus beds really. I love plants, but I loathe babying them. I look for full sun, drought tolerant, deer resistant, perennials that do well in Texas. Basically, I want to stick them in the ground and forget about them while also attracting bees and hummingbirds.

I'll try and be as thorough as possible with what we're doing to our yard. It's an ongoing process!

## Landscaping resources

It's surprisingly easy to do. A great resource is the [Texas A&M Horticulture site](https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/). There are all kinds of plants and ideas in there to make DIY landscaping simple and beautiful. Really all it takes is a lot of time...and some money, but mostly time.

If you have a local discovery center or similar, keep an eye out for plant sales. They usually get them donated then sell them to help the center. Ours just had a sale and plants started at $2.50- you cannot beat it! It's hard for big box stores to compete, however they are more convenient.

A&M also has Master Gardener classes and certifications where you can learn all about plant life and become an expert. I'm planning on joining the next session whenever classes start again. In the meantime, I got [Neil Sperry's book Lone Star Gardening](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0991620704/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=codybear0e-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0991620704&linkId=74f76ac6c171a16d6200b8a0ce2c284e) that outlines all kinds of native plants and has a calendar of when you should plant what. He's super informative and also hosts a radio show about gardening.

You can find lots of ideas and tips on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) as well. There are entire collections dedicated to urban gardening, fairy gardens, Japanese-inspired backyards, xeriscaping, outdoor entertaining, DIYs and the list goes on.
