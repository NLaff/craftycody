When we bought this house, the yard looked nice. I believe the previous owner really loved taking care of the lawn. However, there wasn't much in the way of gardens, plants, or ornamentation.

We started renovating immediately after purchasing and moved in once the reno was completed. Since we weren't in the house for a couple of months during the summer, the lawn suffered for it. We were left with a mostly dead yard in the front and back.

Slowly but surely we've been dethatching the thick, dead grass and creating flower beds. Well, cactus beds really. I love plants, but I loathe babying them. I look for full sun, drought tolerant, deer resistant, perennials that do well in Texas. Basically, I want to stick them in the ground and forget about them while also attracting bees and hummingbirds.

I'll try and be as thorough as possible with what we're doing to our yard. It's an ongoing process!

## Landscaping resources

It feels incredibly daunting at first, but it's surprisingly easy to do. You have to start in small sections instead of taking on the whole yard in one big go. Unless you're hiring a landscaping company, then go for it.

A great resource is the [Texas A&M Horticulture site](https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/). There are all kinds of plants and ideas in there to make DIY landscaping simple and beautiful. Really all it takes is a lot of time...and some money, but mostly time.

If you have a local discovery center or similar, keep an eye out for plant sales. They usually get them donated then sell them to help the center. Ours just had a sale and plants started at $2.50- you cannot beat it! It's hard for big box stores to compete, however they are more convenient.

A&M also has Master Gardener classes and certifications where you can learn all about plant life and become an expert. I'm planning on joining the next session whenever classes start again. In the meantime, I got [Neil Sperry's book Lone Star Gardening](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0991620704/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=codybear0e-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0991620704&linkId=74f76ac6c171a16d6200b8a0ce2c284e) that outlines all kinds of native plants and has a calendar of when you should plant what. He's super informative and also hosts a radio show about gardening. His book is [less expensive on his website.](https://neilsperry.com/store/5th-printing-of-neil-sperrys-lone-star-gardening/)

You can find lots of ideas and tips on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) as well. There are entire collections dedicated to urban gardening, fairy gardens, Japanese-inspired backyards, xeriscaping, outdoor entertaining, DIYs and the list goes on.

## Front yard

Our front yard was in the roughest shape. The trees aren't big enough to provide much shade and the sun just beats down all day, every day. There were two garden beds under the windows that had less than ideal plants- particularly the bed under our large, picture window. These beds were the first things we changed.

They were lined with old landscape fabric and the beds themselves were bordered with wood beams that were absolutely filled with termites. I love wood as much as the next person, but you really have to be careful when putting it out in your yard because you can invite pests and rot if not done properly. We tossed the wood and my FIL brought some beautiful stone bricks to re-line the beds with and I love them. They look cleaner and more professional in my opinion. Also, termites don't eat stone!

We also pulled out the plants under the picture window. My husband wasn't a fan and they looked like they might be dead anyway. I didn't have a preference, but I love making things ours so I was happy to replace them with a bunch of pretty flowers. Hopefully, we'll get some bees and hummingbirds as these babies grow.

The grass was toast when we finally moved in. We treated it with some lawn fertilizer and it's slowly coming back, but it was a good time to start dethatching and putting in garden beds since it was dead anyway. You don't have to feel guilty about pulling up lush grass.

## Backyard

Why is 'backyard' one word and 'front yard' two words?

Anyway, the backyard was one of the reasons I loved the house. You can reno the house itself and make it look however you want, but giant trees are hard to come by. It's near impossible to plant 40-year-old trees to get the feeling I wanted when we were looking for a home. When I saw this house had 5 old trees in the backyard, it was pretty much a done deal for me. I wish there were some in the front, but the two that are out there will grow.
