When we bought this house, the yard looked nice. I believe the previous owner really loved taking care of the lawn. However, there wasn't much in the way of gardens, plants, or ornamentation.

We started renovating immediately after purchasing and moved in once the reno was completed. Since we weren't in the house for a couple of months during the summer, the lawn suffered for it.
