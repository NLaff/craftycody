I've been baking for many years and, for the most part, enjoy it quite a bit. For the effort you put in, you get more food that lasts longer than when you cook dinner and everyone is done eating in 10 minutes.

However, sometimes I just don't feel like making everything from scratch. It takes time, I might not have an ingredient, or, like in this case, my tried and true recipe has disappeared from the internet. 

I had a great recipe for red velvet cupcakes and homemade icing. They were always a hit, but when I decided to make them a couple of weeks ago the recipe had been deleted from the website. It was very upsetting. Now I have to find a new recipe and vet it before making it for people. It's always a hassle and red velvet can be particularly time-consuming.
