I started a short series on the basics of crochet a while ago. I wasn't finding what I wanted on YouTube, so I decided to make my own. The results are quick, simple videos that, hopefully, explain the basics to help you get started on your journey into crochet. 

I will be making more and adding to the series, but they will be on subsequent blog posts. For now, here are my first 3 explaining the basic stitches.
