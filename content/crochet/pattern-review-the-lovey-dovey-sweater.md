The ["Lovey Dovey Sweater" is a crochet pattern by CozyCreativeCrochets](https://www.cozycreativecrochets.com/product-page/the-lovey-dovey-sweater-crochet-pattern) aka Heather Cummings and is available for purchase on her website. I started following [her Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cozycreativecrochets/) when the app suggested I might like her page. 

Spoiler alert: I do like her stuff! 

She has a lot of unique tops that were the style I was after. I love sweaters, but since I live in Texas there aren't a lot of opportunities to wear them. Plus, I have a ton of cozy, store-bought ones that I rotate through during our 2 weeks of winter. I was looking for some patterns that were long-sleeved, fairly simple to make, and would be appropriate for our climate- maybe something I could wear into spring perhaps?

I'll post my thoughts and modifications below. I won't be reposting anything from the pattern specifically.

## Review

After Instagram suggested her page, I fell in love with the "Lovey Dovey" sweater. It's a crop top that would work well with high-waisted jeans and skirts and has a fun, boho vibe. I appreciated that it didn't call for bulky yarn and instead uses lighter-weight cotton yarn- definitely what I prefer to make clothing items out of these days. It's also cheaper than bulky yarn, so big plus there.

The pattern itself is fairly easy to follow. It suggests you be an intermediate crocheter and I agree. There were a couple of places I had to re-read to make sure I understood, but all-in-all I don't think I deviated far from the pattern besides the modifications I made for length and sizing.

The real critique I have is the lack of photos. There are only 3 showing the process- e.g. where to attach the yarn to start the sleeves- and 2 of them are practically the same image. It's the front and back in the same stage of completion. For almost $10 I would like more photos detailing what each stage should look like and directions you'll be crocheting since there is a lot of detaching and reattaching. I'm a very visual learner and images for new-to-me patterns help a great deal.
