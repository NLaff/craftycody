Whenever I find blanket yarn on sale, I immediately search patterns on Ravelry. Michaels had them on sale for $5.99/skein which is almost half off.

I found [Jenni's Favorite Chunky Throw Blanket](http://byjennidesigns.blogspot.com/2016/12/jennisfavoritechunkythrowblanket.html) for free and the yarn requirement was low- rare for a blanket. It listed 880 yards which is about four skeins of Bernat blanket yarn. My total for the day was $24.

I picked this totally cute, soft pink color and they, thankfully, had enough for the pattern. All too often you'll find a color you like and they'll only have one or two skeins.
