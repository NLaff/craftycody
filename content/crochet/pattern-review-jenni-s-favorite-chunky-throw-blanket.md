Whenever I find blanket yarn on sale, I immediately search patterns on Ravelry. Michaels had them on sale for $5.99/skein which is almost half off. 

I found Jenni's Favorite Chunky Throw Blanket for free and the yarn requirement was low- rare for a blanket. It listed 880 yards which is about 4 skeins of Bernat blanket yarn. My total for the day was $24.
