I don't like to buy things and I really don't like buying things that I believe I can make.

However, as crafters, we make all sorts of things but blow a bunch of money on the supplies. Yes, we made it ourselves, but we're still out the same (if not more) amount of money than if we had just purchased the item originally.

Well, with wood being so expensive right now, building your own furniture can be just as expensive as buying something in store. I wanted to get a little more into carpentry, but the startup cost is pretty high. Never mind the wood, you need saws, sanders, levels, squares, rulers, hammers, drills, screws, stains, and a host of other things to supply a decent workshop.

So you gotta start small. I have a jigsaw, drill, and sander. That's gotten me through most of these projects.

The wood I used for the nightstands is[ 2x2 pressure-treated balusters](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Severe-Weather-Common-2-in-x-2-in-x-42-in-Actual-1-31-in-x-1-31-in-x-41-75-in-Pressure-Treated-Brown-Deck-Baluster/50279745). They're about $1.88 at Lowe's, a little more at places like McCoys. You're going to need a lot of them for this project.

## Supplies:

 1. 2x2x42 (sometimes 36in long) balusters. I used 12 and had a mix of both lengths.
 2. Jigsaw
 3. Wood screws
 4. Drill
 5. Wood glue
 6. Sander
 7. Ruler
 8. Stain
 9. Dowels (3/8in)
10. Polyurathene

## Process:

I'll put in all of my measurements of course, but this project is completely customizable to your needs.

We're going to be making three sections (a tabletop, lower top, and legs) and attaching them together.

Here's how I divided up my wood pieces:

**\[x2\] 42in long = Legs  
\[x4\] 42in long = Middle  
\[x6\] 36in long = Tabletop**

The reason I had different lengths is that they sell 36in balusters at McCoys and 42in balusters at Lowe's.
