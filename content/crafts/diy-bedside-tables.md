I don't like to buy things and I really don't like buying things that I believe I can make.

However, as crafters, we make all sorts of things but blow a bunch of money on the supplies. Yes, we made it ourselves, but we're still out the same (if not more) amount of money than if we had just purchased the item originally.

Well, with wood being so expensive right now, building your own furniture can be just as expensive as buying something in store. I wanted to get a little more into carpentry, but the startup cost is pretty high. Never mind the wood, you need saws, sanders, levels, squares, rulers, hammers, drills, screws, stains, and a host of other things to supply a decent workshop.

So you gotta start small. I have a jigsaw, drill, and sander. That's gotten me through most of these projects.

The wood I used for the nightstands is[ 2x2 pressure-treated balusters](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Severe-Weather-Common-2-in-x-2-in-x-42-in-Actual-1-31-in-x-1-31-in-x-41-75-in-Pressure-Treated-Brown-Deck-Baluster/50279745). They're about $1.88 at Lowe's, a little more at places like McCoys. You're going to need a lot of them for this project.

## Supplies:

 1. 2x2x42 (sometimes 36in long) balusters. I used 12 and had a mix of both lengths.
 2. Jigsaw
 3. Wood screws
 4. Drill
 5. Wood glue
 6. Clamps
 7. Sander
 8. Ruler
 9. Stain
10. Dowels (3/8in)
11. Polyurathene

## Process:

I'll put in all of my measurements of course, but this project is completely customizable to your needs.

We're going to be making three sections (a tabletop, lower top, and legs) and attaching them together.

Here's how I divided up my wood pieces:

**\[x2\] 42in long = Legs  
\[x4\] 42in long = Middle  
\[x6\] 36in long = Tabletop**

The reason I had different lengths is that they sell 36in balusters at McCoys and 42in balusters at Lowe's.

Once you get all your measurements right and buy enough wood the project itself is pretty straightforward.

I started with the tabletop and cut twelve 17in pieces from my 36in long balusters. Remember wood has a common size and an actual size. These boards are actually about 1.3inx1.3in square, not 2in square. I lined the pieces up, glued in between them, made sure they were flush with one another and clamped them in place.

Next, I quickly cut four 19in legs from two of my 42in balusters.

When the top dried I attached the legs. I wanted hidden screws, so I measured about an inch in from the edge on the second from the top and the second from the bottom balusters. I traced where the leg would go
