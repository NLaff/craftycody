+++
I have been wanting a knife block for _years_. We have one large knife we use all the time and it sits out on the cutting board when not in use. It bothered me so much that it didn't have a home.

While I was looking around for simple DIYs, I came across this [knife block tutorial](https://www.wwgoa.com/article/walnut-knife-block/) after finding one for my bottle opener. The author created such a simple design that's easy on the budget and can be done by a beginner (like yours truly!).

I had to make some alterations because, as usual, I don't have all of the same tools so I will lay out my supplies and process below in case you're working with the minimum like I was.

## Supplies:

1. 5in wide and 3/4" thick wood boards. I grabbed red cedar.
2. 1/4" square dowel rods
3. Jigsaw
4. Coping saw or flush cut saw
5. Sander
6. Wood glue
7. Ruler or measuring tape
8. Polyurethane
9. Stain (for the dowels)
