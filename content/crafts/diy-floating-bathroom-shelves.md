The only saw I ever wanted was a jigsaw. They're maneuverable and, with mild effort, can cut a straight line. Their versatility and portability make them an attractive first saw for any handywoman thinking about building something. You are limited on thicker pieces of wood where a miter saw would shine, but if you don't mind making a couple of extra cuts then you're all good. (BETTER FOR A JIGSAW REVIEW?)

Our bathroom needed some details to spruce it up. When we bought the house, the primary bath looked completely different than it does now. All the big things were updated and now it's time to add some personality and tchotchkes.

The space above the vanity was looking a little barren. We removed the light and had recessed lighting installed instead, so we were left with a big, blank wall that now has a singular mirror on it. I wanted to get some greenery in there, but there was no place to put potted plants or anything else for that matter sans hanging something.

Lightbulb: shelving. I had spare plywood from the shelf I made for our pantry and I've always liked how corner shelves look. Time to experiment!

I used a piece of yarn to measure out how wide I wanted my shelves and decide what would look good for the space. Since one would be over a towel rack and the sink, I didn't want them to be too big and be in the way, but they also needed to hold decor. I decided that about **14 inches** wide would work just fine.

I measured out the hypotenuse of the shelves to be 14 inches and used a level to make sure my ruler was straight. This would be easier if you have a larger square ruler. Then, I brought out my trusty jigsaw and cut down the line I made.
