I recently acquired a beautiful waterfall vanity. I've been wanting one for a couple of years now and have kept an eye out on Craigslist. Finally, I found one that was both reasonably priced and close by.

However, to use a vanity you need a seat and I did not have one. That became quest number two.

On a trip to Dallas, I went with my mom to an antique market. I love this place so much. I figured if anyone was going to have an old chair, it would be this place.

Lo and behold, I found one. The seat was broken, the fabric was dirty, and the paint was chipped, but it was perfect. It was also pretty cheap, which helped.

I had no intentions of doing anything to the vanity itself, but the chair I could do anything to. So I did.

Here we go:

## Supplies:

 1. Jigsaw
 2. Drill
 3. Sander
 4. Pliers
 5. Plywood
 6. Fabric
 7. Stuffing
 8. Buttons
 9. Needle and thread
10. Spray paint
11. Ruler and pencil

## Process:

The first step was taking the cushions off of the chair, which is easy enough. Each one was attached with three screws, so I used my drill to quickly unscrew them and detach. Now, I could take my drill with my rust/paint remover bit and go over all the rusty bits on the metal frame. This made cleaning it much easier than going over everything with a cloth first.

I chipped away all the rust and dirt I saw, gave it a light clean with some bleach, then it was time to spray paint. I went with matte gold.

While the chair was drying, I needed to make a new seat. The particleboard (or whatever it was) completely deteriorated and was unusable. I measure the diameter of the seat then halved it for the radius. I cut a piece of string that was the length of the radius and attached one end to a pencil. I held down the tip of the string on my new plywood and drew a circle around. It isn't a perfect science, but how I learned how to draw a pretty good circle in elementary school.

I used my jigsaw to cut out the circle. This is the first time I've used it to cut curves, which is was it was made to do. It did a great job. I did have to trim the circle down a couple of times since it was a little too wide for the chair itself, but it wasn't too bad for a first attempt. Then, I sanded the sides, top, and bottom of my new seat.

I taped off the sides to make a square and labeled the spots where the new buttons would go for tufting. The original had 16, so this one would too. I drilled 2 small holes per button that would be used to feed the string through and tie-down.
