I recently acquired a beautiful waterfall vanity. I've been wanting one for a couple of years now and have kept an eye out on Craigslist. Finally, I found one that was both reasonably priced and close by.

However, to use a vanity you need a seat and I did not have one. That became quest number two.

On a trip to Dallas, I went with my mom to an antique market. I love this place so much. I figured if anyone was going to have an old chair, it would be this place.

Lo and behold, I found one. The seat was broken, the fabric was dirty, and the paint was chipped, but it was perfect. It was also pretty cheap, which helped.

I had no intentions of doing anything to the vanity itself, but the chair I could do anything to. So I did.

Here we go:

## Supplies:

 1. Jigsaw
 2. Drill
 3. Pliers
 4. Plywood
 5. Fabric
 6. Stuffing
 7. Buttons
 8. Needle and thread
 9. Spray paint
10. Ruler and pencil

## Process:

The first step was taking the cushions off of the chair, which is easy enough. Each one was attached with three screws, so I used my drill to quickly unscrew them and detach. Now, I could take my drill with my rust/paint remover bit and go over all the rusty bits on the metal frame. This made cleaning it much easier than going over everything with a cloth first.

I chipped away all the rust and dirt I saw, gave it a light clean with some bleach, then it was time to spray paint. I went with matte gold.
