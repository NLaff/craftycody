I recently acquired a beautiful waterfall vanity. I've been wanting one for a couple of years now and have kept an eye out on Craigslist. Finally, I found one that was both reasonably priced and close by.

However, to use a vanity you need a seat and I did not have one. That became quest number two.

On a trip to Dallas, I went with my mom to an antique market. I love this place so much. I figured if anyone was going to have an old chair, it would be this place.

Lo and behold, I found one. The seat was broken, the fabric was dirty, and the paint was chipped, but it was perfect. It was also pretty cheap, which helped.

I had no intentions of doing anything to the vanity itself, but the chair I could do anything to. So I did.

Here we go:

## Supplies:

1. Jigsaw
2. Drill
3. Plywood
4. Fabric
5. Stuffing
6. Buttons
7. Needle and thread
8. Spray paint
9. Ruler and pencil

## Process:
