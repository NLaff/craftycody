+++
The only saw I ever wanted was a jigsaw. They're maneuverable and, with some effort, can cut a straight line. Their versatility and portability make them an attractive first saw for any handywoman thinking about building something. You are limited on thicker pieces of wood where a miter saw would shine, but if you don't mind making a couple of extra cuts then you're all good.

My birthday rolled around and my parents asked me what I would like. I was in a new phase of building things but really needed a power saw. I asked for the Dewalt cordless jigsaw. Lowe's even had a bundle deal where you got a drill, impact driver, multi-tool, and got to pick a free tool as a bonus. My free tool was the jigsaw.

## Features

Let's start from the top and work out way down.

The handle is very comfortable and sets your hand a safe distance away from the blade.

## Performance

So, does it cut?

Yes, very well.

Wood feels like butter.

Jigsaws are not meant to cut straight, but I came up with a trick (which I'm sure many others before me have done). I clamp a piece of scrap wood to the board I'm cutting and make sure it's level. I use this as a guide for the jigsaw. I cut right up against that scrap piece and can usually get a pretty straight cut.

What about metal?

I don't think many of us need to cut too much metal, but this little guy can do it. I had to cut a metal (aluminum, maybe?) curtain rod down so that it would fit into my trash bin. It took a little doing because of the awkward shape, but it cut through enough to where I could snap it the rest of the way. This saw shouldn't have any problems with flat sheet metal.

## Value/Quality

## Safety Tips

The first thing to always keep in mind when working with power tools is safety and safety is enforced with repetition. I always wear gloves and safety glasses when using tools. What I always do when putting my jigsaw away is make sure the safety lock is on and turn the speed dial down to 1. Then, when I know the trigger is locked, pull the battery out and set it aside. I also pull the trigger to make sure there is no "juice" in the tool and then lock it again. Last, I take the saw blade out and store it away in a small case. Be careful as the blade may be hot after use.

## Summary

I'm incredibly happy with this little saw. It's been invaluable to me and even whenever I inevitably get a miter saw, I will still be using this for its portability and quickness.
