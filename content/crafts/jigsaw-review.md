The only saw I ever wanted was a jigsaw. They're maneuverable and, with mild effort, can cut a straight line. Their versatility and portability make them an attractive first saw for any handywoman thinking about building something. You are limited on thicker pieces of wood where a miter saw would shine, but if you don't mind making a couple of extra cuts then you're all good. (BETTER FOR A JIGSAW REVIEW?)
