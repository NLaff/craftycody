This is truly a straightforward DIY that you can do in an afternoon. The most time-consuming part is waiting for the stain to dry- as is the case with most of my tutorials. It's a great way to get rid of spare supplies and you might have everything you need already making it a relatively cheap project.

If you're like me, then you have a ton of scrap wood laying around in your workspace (i.e. my garage). It's a great resource for small projects, but how do you decide what to make with them? You search Pinterest until you find inspiration, that's how.

I happened to be looking at bedroom decor ideas and spotted a super cute, wooden tray sitting on a bed. Instantly I thought: "I could make that." So I did and here's how.

## Supplies:

1.  Scrap wood. You'll need a long piece for the tray and two smaller ones for the edges
2.  Handles. I used spare ones we had from our kitchen remodel.
3.  Stain
4.  Wood Glue
5.  Jigsaw
6.  Sander

## Process:

My scrap wood came from the [built-in desk](https://craftycody.com/crafts/built-in-desk-diy/) I just installed in our guest room.
