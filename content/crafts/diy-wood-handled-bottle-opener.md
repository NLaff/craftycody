I wanted to find some simple woodworking ideas to make as a gift. I found this [bottle opener guide](https://www.wwgoa.com/article/how-to-make-a-wood-handled-bottle-opener/) and adapted it to work for me. I don't have all the tools used so I needed to make do with what I had!

And what I had was a Dremel. I've never used it so extensively as I did with this project. I'm happy I had it otherwise I probably could not have done this. I have the [Dremel Stylo+](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077Y86FKJ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=codybear0e-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B077Y86FKJ&linkId=29fecb7a6b7a887fcb2d7213a6c0deec) and originally bought it for these wooden rings I made. It took me a couple of days to carve the wood down to where I liked. Be sure to take breaks as your hand will cramp up.

## Supplies:

 1. Scrap wood
 2. Bottle opener
 3. Dremel Stylo+
 4. Jigsaw
 5. Drill
 6. Screws
 7. Drill bit for stainless steel
 8. Wood glue
 9. Clamps
10. Dowel rods
11. Flush cut saw or coping saw
12. Stain
13. Polyurethane

## Process:

The first thing you have to do is find a metal bottle opener that will work. I went to HEB and [got this flat, wide one](https://www.heb.com/product-detail/true-trueblade-bottle-opener-each/1996975) I knew I'd be able to drill into and create a handle around. If you have an old bottle opener laying around, feel free to use that one.

Another thing you'll need is a drill bit that can drill into stainless steel. I estimated what size I would need- kinda small. Not the most scientific way to do it, but it worked for me. I bought the one below from Lowe's:

I had some scrap wood that was perfect for this project- you don't need much! I measured two pieces and cut them to be the same size. Then placed my opener on one piece and traced around it. I needed to know where I would be carving into the wood to make an indentation for the opener to lay flat in otherwise the two wood pieces would have a gap between them.

Now begins the heavy Dremel use. That will be about 80-90% of this project- carving. The Dremel I have came with a lot of different heads and I picked one meant for wood. It was a rounded head, but I will be using the cone-shaped one later.
