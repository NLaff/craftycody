+++
I wanted to find some simple woodworking ideas to make as a gift. I found this [bottle opener guide](https://www.wwgoa.com/article/how-to-make-a-wood-handled-bottle-opener/) and adapted it to work for me. I don't have all the tools used so I needed to make do with what I had!

And what I had was a Dremel. I've never used it so extensively as I did with this project. I'm happy I had it otherwise I probably could not have done this. I have the Dremel Stylo+ and originally bought it for these wooden rings I made.
