There are few things that refresh a space quicker than paint.

Need a new mood in your bedroom? Paint.

That old piece of furniture not in style anymore? Paint.

Someone decided that an entire bathroom would look good in the same shade of taupe? PAINT.

And there's where I was at. We remodeled our home before moving in but didn't touch the guest bath as it had gotten a face-lift in the last, let's say, 15 years. We decided that we would do it later when inspiration struck.

Well, I can't speak for inspiration, but I was getting sick of the color. I don't really like browns (except wood of course) and that whole bathroom is brown. Walls, ceiling, cabinets, countertop, tile, toilet, everything. I hate it.

So, I've started changing it little by little and what I can do is paint just about every surface to get it closer to something I like. I decided to start with the cabinets.

I've seen tons of people online struggle with the best way to paint cabinets. I came across a video a while ago that illustrated a top tip for painting them- foam rollers.
