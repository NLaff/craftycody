There are few things that refresh a space quicker than paint.

Need a new mood in your bedroom? Paint.

That old piece of furniture not in style anymore? Paint.

Someone decided that an entire bathroom would look good in the same shade of taupe? PAINT.

And there's where I was at. We remodeled our home before moving in but didn't touch the guest bath as it had gotten a face-lift in the last, let's say, 15 years. We decided that we would do it later when inspiration struck.

Well, I can't speak for inspiration, but I was getting sick of the color. I don't really like browns (except wood of course) and that whole bathroom is brown. Walls, ceiling, cabinets, countertop, tile, toilet, everything. I hate it.

So, I've started changing it little by little and what I can do is paint just about every surface to get it closer to something I like. I decided to start with the cabinets.

I've seen tons of people online struggle with the best way to paint cabinets. I came across a video a while ago that illustrated a top tip for painting them- **foam rollers**.

Let me tell you, they work _wonders_. I've also started using them whenever I paint furniture. The paint goes on so evenly and there are no brush strokes. They also make a really satisfying sticky sound as you paint.

Alright, let's see how these cabinets turned out.

## Supplies:

1. Paint. I went with white as it's easy to paint back over and will match whatever I do to the walls.
2.

3. Handles- if you want to change yours out.
4. Drill
5. Sandpaper or sander
6. Ruler or measuring tape

## Process:

There really isn't much to the process, but I'll try to remember any tips that made it go faster.

I took off all the doors and drawers then removed their old handles. All the hinges and screws I kept in a little bowl for later. You could always spray paint handles and hinges for a new look instead of purchasing new ones.

I brought everything out into the garage to paint. For the doors, I needed to drill new holes because the new handles were longer than the old ones. I kept the top hole so the spacing would be the same on all four doors and I didn't have to measure. The bottom holes I filled with caulk and used a putty knife to scrape off any excess so it would be flat. Let that dry, then place your new handle over the existing hole and mark where you need a new bottom one. Use your drill with a bit that's about the same size as the handle's screw and drill a new bottom hole.

The drawers were a little trickier since I needed to redrill both holes. I filled in the old and marked the new spots where the handle laid in the middle of the drawer. I measured where those were and did the same markings on the second drawer then drilled.

Now that the holes are there
