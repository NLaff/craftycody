When we bought our house the guest room had a small nook by the closet with a plywood shelf and a curtain hanging from it to conceal...something. I never found out what that something was, but if I had to guess it was a litter box.

After we renovated, we were left with this small space that we weren't quite sure what to do with. It fit a dresser just fine, but the guest room didn't really need one. I had painted a larger one that was in there as well and has a nice, long tabletop for knick-knacks. We had a table right there for a bit and my folks liked being able to put their suitcase on it, but it didn't really fit the room and was more of a functional piece. Plus, I re-painted it and moved it into the sunroom where it's way cuter.

Then, when my husband made the permanent switch to a standing desk, we had an extra office chair that found its way to that nook. He had the idea of putting in a floating desk to take calls or do crafts on. We could hang shelves above it and give the room a little more personality than just a bed and a dresser. 

Well, time to get to work.

Here's what I did:

## Supplies:

 1. Two 3/4" plywood boards (nice) for tabletops. This is if you want to glue them together for a thicker top. In retrospect, I would have only gotten one.
 2. 2x4s for mounts
 3. 1x3s for trim
 4. Screws (3-4in)
 5. Wood glue
 6. Jigsaw
 7. Drill/Impact driver
 8. Level
 9. Sander
10. Stain and brush
11. Measuring tape

## Process

Measure twice, cut once. That will be the theme of this whole DIY. The width of my nook was _almost_ 38 1/4" inches, but the right wall sloped in slightly meaning that the gap was narrower in some places. Great, thank you old house.

I cut my plywood boards a little shorter than I needed so they would fit snuggly against the back wall. Nothing went in straight. Everything went in at an angle to miss that narrow bit and was laid down at the back.

The 2/4s were much simpler since they're only 2 inches wide versus about 24 inches like the plywood. I cut one the width of the back wall and mounted it into two studs. This table will be heavy- find your studs! This is also the first time I've used Torx screws and oh my goodness I will never go back. Our contractors used them and I've read quite a bit about them in [r/HomeImprovement](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/) over on Reddit. They don't strip! They're magnificent. I used this project as an excuse to get a jar of them. Hopefully, I'll need 4-inch screws in the future!
