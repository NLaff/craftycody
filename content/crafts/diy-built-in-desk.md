When we bought our house the guest room had a small nook by the closet with a plywood shelf and a curtain hanging from it to conceal...something. I never found out what that something was, but if I had to guess it was a litter box.

After we renovated, we were left with this small space that we weren't quite sure what to do with. It fit a dresser just fine, but the guest room didn't really need one. Plus I had painted a larger one that was in there as well and has a nice, long tabletop for knick-knacks.

Then, when my husband made the permanent switch to a standing desk, we had an extra office chair that found its way to that nook. He had the idea of putting in a floating desk to take calls or do crafts on. We could hang shelves above it and give the room a little more personality than just a bed and a dresser.

So, here's what I did:

## Supplies:

 1. 3/4" plywood (nice) boards for tabletops
 2. 2x4s for mounts
 3. 1x3s for trim
 4. Screws
 5. Wood glue
 6. Jigsaw
 7. Drill/Impact driver
 8. Level
 9. Sander
10. Stain
11. Measuring tape
