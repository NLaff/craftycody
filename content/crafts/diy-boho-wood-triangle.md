I love to build and make things. What I don't love is how expensive tools are. So, I'm going to try and make fun, inspired pieces with as few tools as possible and as inexpensively possible. We're going to make a boho-style triangle to hang on the wall. If made thick enough then it can be used as a shelf.

This is the first tutorial where the only power tools I use are a jigsaw, impact driver, and sander. You can always sand by hand and use a drill if you don't have an impact driver. Also, if you have a circular saw, you can use that instead of a jigsaw however having some kind of power saw is important because it'll be very difficult and time-consuming to saw by hand.

Let's get started.

Power Tools:

1. Jigsaw
2. Impact Driver
3. Sheet Sander

Supplies:

1. Stain
2. Screws
3. Wood glue
4. Scrap plywood
5. Coping saw
6. Ruler
7. Square or Protractor for angles
8. Clamps
9. Pencil

The wood I used was leftover from my corner shelf project I did in my bathroom. It's plywood I bought from Lowe's for about $18 and got three solid projects out of it- not too bad!

I started by clamping it to my workbench and trimming off the excess with my jigsaw to get a nice rectangle. It was 6 inches wide, so I marked off 2-inch spaces to get 3 even pieces for my triangle. As I said earlier, if you can get wider pieces then you can use this as a shelf, but I think mine is a little too narrow to put things in and just serves as wall decor.

Next, I used my saw to cut the strips apart and that's it for the jigsaw!
